## Recent Major Achievements

### Real-time Collaborative Painting System
- **Multi-user sessions**: Multiple users can paint simultaneously on shared canvas
- **Live presence tracking**: Real-time cursor positions and user indicators
- **Session management**: URL-based session sharing and joining
- **Stroke synchronization**: All brush strokes appear instantly across all users
- **User identification**: Random names and colors for each participant

### Technical Implementation
- **Convex Backend**: Real-time database with WebSocket connections
- **React Hooks**: Custom `usePaintingSession` hook for state management
- **Canvas Integration**: Updated Canvas component with real-time features
- **Session Info UI**: User-friendly session sharing and presence display

## Known Issues
- Undo/redo needs session-wide implementation
- Clear canvas needs session-wide implementation
- Mobile optimization pending
- No authentication system yet

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Latest Changes (Real-time Collaboration)
- **Added Convex backend** for real-time data synchronization
- **Implemented collaborative features** beyond original scope
- **Session-based architecture** for multi-user support
- **URL sharing system** for easy session joining

### Initial Planning
- Decided on TanStack Start over Next.js for better full-stack integration
- Chose Convex over Supabase for simpler real-time features
- Selected Ideogram V2 Turbo for inpainting quality
- Opted for single canvas approach for simplicity

### Key Design Choices
1. **No signup required** - Reduces friction for users
2. **Real-time collaboration** - Enhanced user experience
3. **Session-based sharing** - Easy collaboration via URL
4. **Random user identification** - Simple onboarding

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components
- `Canvas.tsx` - Real-time collaborative canvas with perfect-freehand
- `PaintingView.tsx` - Main container with session management
- `ToolPanel.tsx` - Drawing tools and controls
- `SessionInfo.tsx` - User presence and session sharing
- `usePaintingSession.ts` - Custom hook for real-time state

### Backend Schema (Convex)
- `paintingSessions` - Session metadata and canvas settings
- `strokes` - Individual brush strokes with ordering
- `userPresence` - Real-time user cursor positions and status

### Real-time Features
- WebSocket connections via Convex
- Optimistic UI updates for smooth experience
- Presence system for cursor tracking
- Stroke ordering for consistent history

## Performance Metrics
- ✅ < 3s time to first paint (achieved)
- ✅ 60fps drawing performance (achieved)
- ⏳ Real-time latency < 100ms (needs measurement)
- ⏳ < 5s inpainting response (pending AI integration)

## User Testing Instructions

### Multi-Session Testing
1. **Multiple tabs**: Open `http://localhost:3000/` in multiple browser tabs
2. **Session sharing**: Click "Share session" to copy URL and open in new tabs
3. **Different browsers**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari simultaneously
4. **Incognito mode**: Use private windows for separate user sessions

### Expected Behavior
- Each user gets unique name and color
- Live cursor tracking with user names
- Instant stroke synchronization
- User count updates in real-time
- Session persistence via URL

## Technical Debt
- Session-wide undo/redo implementation needed
- Mobile touch optimization required
- Error handling for network issues
- Performance optimization for large stroke counts

## Risk Assessment
1. **Low Risk**: Basic drawing implementation ✅
2. **Medium Risk**: Convex integration complexity ✅ (resolved)
3. **High Risk**: Inpainting API costs at scale ⏳
4. **New Risk**: Real-time performance with many users
5. **Mitigation**: Implement rate limits, optimize stroke storage

## Next Session Starting Point
Ready for Phase 3 - AI Inpainting:
1. Set up Replicate API integration
2. Implement mask drawing mode
3. Create inpainting workflow
4. Handle async AI processing
5. Merge AI results back to collaborative canvas

## Deployment Notes
- Convex backend deployed and configured
- Real-time WebSocket connections working
- Need Replicate API key for AI features
- Consider CDN for static assets
- Monitor real-time connection costs
