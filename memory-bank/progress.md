## Technical Implementation Details

### Live Stroke System Architecture
The live stroke system enables users to see brush strokes being drawn in real-time by other users:

1. **Live Stroke Broadcasting**: As a user draws, each pointer move event updates their live stroke in the database
2. **Real-time Display**: Other users see live strokes rendered on the drawing canvas overlay
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Live strokes are automatically removed when:
   - The user completes their stroke (converted to permanent stroke)
   - The stroke becomes stale (30+ seconds old via cron job)
   - The user disconnects (handled by presence system)

### Canvas Architecture
- **Main Canvas**: Renders committed strokes from the database
- **Drawing Canvas**: Renders live strokes, current user's in-progress stroke, and user cursors
- **Dual-layer System**: Prevents flickering and provides smooth real-time updates

### Data Flow
1. User starts drawing → Live stroke created/updated in database
2. Other users receive live stroke updates via subscription
3. Live strokes rendered on drawing canvas overlay
4. User completes stroke → Live stroke deleted, permanent stroke created
5. Permanent stroke appears on main canvas for all users

## Current Status
The core real-time collaborative painting system is **COMPLETE** with live stroke functionality. Users can now see each other's brush strokes being drawn in real-time, providing a truly collaborative painting experience.

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Brush tool variations (pencil, marker, etc.)
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Layer system
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Mobile touch optimization
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large sessions
