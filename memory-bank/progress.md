# iPaintAI - Progress Tracker

## Current Status
- **Project Phase**: Phase 1 - Core Drawing (In Progress)
- **Implementation**: Development environment setup complete
- **Last Updated**: Fixed Tailwind CSS v4 configuration issues

## What Works
- ✅ Project requirements gathered
- ✅ Technical architecture defined
- ✅ Development phases planned
- ✅ Memory Bank initialized

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Core Drawing (Week 1)
- [x] Initialize TanStack Start project
- [x] Set up development environment
- [x] Create canvas component
- [x] Integrate perfect-freehand
- [x] Implement drawing tools
- [x] Add color picker
- [x] Add size/opacity controls
- [x] Implement undo/redo
- [x] Add clear canvas function

### Phase 2: Backend & Auth (Week 2)
- [ ] Set up Convex project
- [ ] Define database schema
- [ ] Implement authentication
- [ ] Create save functionality
- [ ] Add load functionality
- [ ] Build auth UI components

### Phase 3: AI Inpainting (Week 3)
- [ ] Set up Replicate integration
- [ ] Implement mask drawing
- [ ] Create inpainting API calls
- [ ] Handle async processing
- [ ] Merge results to canvas
- [ ] Add loading states

### Phase 4: Polish & Deploy (Week 4)
- [ ] Implement export feature
- [ ] Add auto-save
- [ ] Optimize for mobile
- [ ] Performance tuning
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Known Issues
- None yet (project not started)

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Planning (Current)
- Decided on TanStack Start over Next.js for better full-stack integration
- Chose Convex over Supabase for simpler real-time features
- Selected Ideogram V2 Turbo for inpainting quality
- Opted for single canvas approach for simplicity

### Key Design Choices
1. **No signup required** - Reduces friction for users
2. **Minimal tools** - Focus on core painting experience
3. **Direct mask drawing** - Same tool for painting and masking
4. **Auto-save for logged users** - Prevents work loss

## Technical Debt
- None accumulated yet

## Performance Metrics
- Target: < 3s time to first paint
- Target: 60fps drawing performance
- Target: < 5s inpainting response

## User Feedback
- No feedback yet (awaiting implementation)

## Deployment Notes
- Will need Convex deployment
- Replicate API key required
- Consider CDN for static assets
- Monitor API usage costs

## Risk Assessment
1. **Low Risk**: Basic drawing implementation
2. **Medium Risk**: Convex integration complexity
3. **High Risk**: Inpainting API costs at scale
4. **Mitigation**: Start with rate limits, monitor usage

## Next Session Starting Point
Begin with Phase 1 implementation:
1. Create new TanStack Start project
2. Set up TypeScript and Tailwind
3. Create basic canvas component
4. Test drawing functionality
