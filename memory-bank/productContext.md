# wepaintAI - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
wepaintAI addresses the gap between simple drawing tools and complex professional software. Many users want to create digital art without the steep learning curve or subscription costs of professional tools. By combining intuitive painting with AI capabilities, wepaintAI makes digital art creation accessible and fun.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Barrier to Entry** - Most painting software requires downloads, installations, or sign-ups before use
2. **Complexity Overload** - Professional tools overwhelm casual users with features
3. **Creative Blocks** - Users struggle with blank canvases or fixing mistakes
4. **Cost** - Quality painting software often requires expensive subscriptions

## How It Works

### User Journey
1. **Immediate Access** - User visits site and can start painting instantly
2. **Natural Drawing** - Brush responds smoothly to mouse/touch input
3. **AI Enhancement** - When stuck or wanting changes, users can mask areas for AI regeneration
4. **Save Progress** - Optional sign-up allows saving and returning to work

### Core Interactions
- **Drawing**: Click/touch and drag to paint with selected brush settings
- **Tool Selection**: Simple toolbar with essential tools only
- **Inpainting**: Select inpaint tool → draw mask → click generate
- **Account**: Sign up/in button in corner, non-intrusive

## User Experience Goals
1. **Zero Friction Start** - No barriers between user and canvas
2. **Intuitive Controls** - Tools work as expected without tutorials
3. **Responsive Feedback** - Immediate visual response to all actions
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Advanced features (auth, save) available but not required
5. **Mobile-First Touch** - Natural touch painting on tablets/phones

## Design Principles
- **Simplicity First** - Every feature must justify its complexity
- **Performance Matters** - Lag kills creativity
- **AI as Assistant** - AI enhances but doesn't replace human creativity
- **Privacy Respected** - Anonymous use by default, data only with consent

## Success Metrics
- Time to first brush stroke < 3 seconds
- User can complete a painting without documentation
- AI inpainting feels magical, not technical
- Users voluntarily create accounts to save work
